## Post-work

### [Repo Pizzas](https://github.com/coders-school/pizzas)

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> (10 XP) Write a TimeMock class to replace the dummy/stub written during the class. Use it through StrictMock. Add appropriate <code>EXPECT_CALL</code> in test code.
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> (15 XP) Add a new test case in which you duplicate the main.cpp functionality, but order 3 pizzas: <code>StubPizza</code> and 2 different <code>MockPizza</code> (different names, prices and baking times; one as StrictMock, the other as NiceMock). Set the right <code>EXPECT_CALL</code>.
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> (5 XP) Create your own .github/workflows/module3.yml file which will cause GitHub to run tests automatically.

+3 XP for each of the 3 points delivered by 20/09 23:59.
