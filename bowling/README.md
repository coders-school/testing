We thought about general concept of our bowling project and we came up with these things.\
In general program should:
1) read the file (for example loadFromFile() which will read data and save it somewhere (perhaps a vector of playerData structs))
2) check the data (for example check if game is finished or still in progress) 
3) calculate score (for example calculateScore() which will count score for players saved by the loadFromFile() function)
3) print out informations based on the data collected (for example rintOutTo(screen / file))
